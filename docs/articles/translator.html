<p>The second is the paths, we can see these three above in the hierarchical structure, but it’s hard to see how many and how they relate. Here the relationships are implicit in the <em>sequence of paths</em>. The <code>object</code> is a feature (a row at the <code>sf</code>-level), and the <code>path</code> is an isolated sequence of coordinates, with a <code>nrow</code> the number of coordinates and <code>ncol</code> the geometric dimension which will match the number of coordinate columns.</p>

<p>That looks ok, but what if we want to know it’s really a hole? We ignored the fact that there are two polygons, and one has a hole.</p>

<p>That worked for single features, but what happens if we put in two?</p>
<p>Clearly we need to not pass ungrouped sets of component paths to spatstat, because it will detect internal boundaries and (very cleverly) remove them. This is an interesting relationship to the simple features standard and makes spatstat consistent with it for that aspect. Other packages don’t care about internal boundaries, including Manifold GIS and some applications for OSM data …</p>
<p>We also need to be careful about ring winding direction, but this gets us into detailed specifics about the relationship between sf and spatstat and that is not the purpose of this document.</p>
