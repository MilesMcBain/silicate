sc
==

The goal of sc is to provide a general common form for complex multi-dimensional data.

See the [proposal.md](proposal.md).

This package is intended to be the central guide to the `common form` approach described here. There's nothing in the package yet, but see these projects that are informed by this approach.

-   **rbgm** - [Atlantis Box Geometry Model](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/rbgm), a "doubly-connected edge-list" form of linked faces and boxes in a spatially-explicit 3D ecosystem model
-   **rangl** - [Primitives for Spatial data](https://github.com/r-gris/rangl), a generalization of GIS forms with simple 3D plotting
-   **spbabel** - [Translators for R Spatial](https://github.com/mdsumner/spbabel), tools to convert from and to spatial forms, provides the general decomposition framework for branches, used by `rangl`
-   **sfct** - [Constrained Triangulation for Simple Features](https://github.com/r-gris/sfct) tools to decompose `simple features` into (non-mesh-indexed) primitives.
