Key examples

multi level features as custom types
trip data as grouped points with measurements, also indexed as lines
Level-3 bins for ocean colour
BGM doubly-connected edge-list model
continuous variation across polygon surfaces
vector data fusion
wireframe curvilinear rasters
Multi-level custom types

state and county sharing vertices, note rules on internal rings (discard them, leave one level for simple features)
pre-computed topologically sound resolutions (i.e. district precision for a state boundary vs. country precision)
a voyage track, intervals within it, fine-resolution underway measures, specific stations
a fused surface, a combination of contour lines with a constant Z fused with polygons without elevation
